        "description": "I worked on this directly after my CHIP-8 Emulator. I really enjoyed both Rust as well as emulation in general, and I thought that this would be a great next step. The emulator can play a significant portion of the system's library without issue, and taught me so much about computers on a low level. It was easily the most fun to complete, and had by far the biggest scope."
